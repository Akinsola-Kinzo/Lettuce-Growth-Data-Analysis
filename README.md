# Lettuce Growth & Environmental Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a 48-day growth cycle of 72 lettuce plants in a controlled environment. The goal was to monitor the relationship between environmental stability (Temperature/Humidity) and water chemistry (pH/TDS) on plant maturity.

## Key Insights
### 1. Growth Performance
- **Target Maturity:** Plants reached a peak maturity of **6.9 weeks**.
- **Consistency:** Growth followed a steady linear trend, suggesting environmental settings were generally effective.

### 2. Water Chemistry (pH & TDS)
- **pH Volatility:** Only **68.7%** of readings were within the optimal range.
- **Action Required:** 31.3% of the cycle required manual intervention to stabilize pH levels.
- **Nutrient Uptake:** TDS levels showed a healthy consumption pattern, averaging **598 ppm**.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel:** Pivot Tables, Power Query, Data Analysis Toolpak (Descriptive Statistics & Correlation), and Advanced Charting (Combo Charts).
- **Data Visualization:** Slicers and Interactive Dashboards.

## Operational Recommendations
- **Automation:** I recommend automating pH buffering to reduce the 31% "Action Required" instances.
- **Zonal Analysis:** Further study is needed to see if specific plant IDs (locations) are more prone to pH drift.
